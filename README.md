# cruz mahjong
For four players

The Cruz clan enjoys a game that uses mahjong tiles, mahjong words, but not mahjong rules.

## setup

1. Mix (halo) the mahjong tiles in the middle and build four walls of about even length, 2 tiles high.
  1. The end result shold be a square

2. Have the last winner roll the dice. The sum of the dice determines who is **mano**, or the starting player.
  1. Note, if both dice have the save value, the winnings will be *doubled*. Indicate this somehow

3. The **mano** can choose any wall other than their own to distribute tiles. Using the value of the dice, count inwards from the chosen wall. (Break between the the counted tiles, **flores**, and the next tile to be counted, the **bunot**). 
Starting from the tiles after the those counted, distribute 4longx2high wall sections to the **mano** first, then continue counter-clockwise until every player has 16 tiles. Deal the **mano** one more tile, the **sawi**
  1. The **mano** can choose to have their **sawi** when dealt their second 8-tiles

### tile disambiguation

## quick setup
1. Deal tiles
2. Convert **flores**
3. Roll for **joker**

## actions

A **set** is three tiles of the same suit, either an incrementing straight (4 5 6) or 3 of a kind

## on other's turn 

**chao** - to form a straight set using the **tapon** (thrown tile) of person before you
**pong** - given a pair, complete your set using anyone's **tapon**
* if you have three of a kind, you can still **pong**
  * if going for *regular win* (5 sets, 1 pair), you can **kang** and get paid 10
    * you can't convert **kang** to 2 pairs after getting paid
  * if going for seven pairs, keep one tile hidden and **pong**. the three of a kind set is now 2 pairs (pong and hidden)
    * you can convert this to **kang** and get paid
    
then you **tapon** (throw a tile)

### on your turn

Become **mano** by getting one tile (**bunot**) from the non-joker, **bunot** side

You are **mano** if you have 17 tiles

Typically, just throw, or **tapon** a tile. 


Alternatively, you may:
* 
before you **tapon**

## winning

If you are missing only one tile to win, you are **puro** and can take the tile if anyone throws it, ever

5 sets and a pair

7 pairs and a set

When the desire card comes, either from **tapon** or **bunot**, call out **todas** because you won and recieve payment

## paying

paningit (in the middle) - 10
