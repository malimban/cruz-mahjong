## setup

This game is played with a standard mahjong set (144 + 4 blanks). There are no joker tiles

1. Mix (**ha-lo**) the mahjong tiles in the middle and build four walls of about even length, 2 tiles high.
    1. The end result shold be a square of face-down tiles
  
2. Have the last winner roll the dice. The sum of the dice determines who is **mano**, or the starting player.
    1. Note, if both dice have the save value, the every pay is *doubled*. Indicate this somehow
  
3. The **mano** can choose any wall other than their own to distribute tiles. Using the value of the dice, count inwards from the chosen wall. (Break between the the counted tiles, **flores**, and the next tile to be counted, the **bunot**). 
Starting from the tiles after the those counted, distribute 4longx2high wall sections to the **mano** first, then continue counter-clockwise until every player has 16 tiles. Deal the **mano** one more tile, the **sawi**
    1. The **mano** can choose to have their **sa-wi** when dealt their second 8-tiles

### tile disambiguation
There are three suits:
* Balls
* Sticks
  * 1 stick is typically a bird with #1
* *Char*acter (pronunced car)

The rest are **flores**

## quick setup
1. Deal tiles
2. Convert **flores**
3. Roll for **joker**



## actions

A **set** is three tiles of the same suit, either an incrementing straight (4 5 6) or 3 of a kind

### on other's turn 

**chao** - to form a straight set using the **tapon** (thrown tile) of person before you
**pong** - given a pair, complete your set using anyone's **tapon**
* if you have three of a kind, you can still **pong**
  * if going for *regular win* (5 sets, 1 pair), you can **kang** and get paid 10
    * you can't convert **kang** to 2 pairs after getting paid
  * if going for seven pairs, keep one tile hidden and **pong**. the three of a kind set is now 2 pairs (pong and hidden)
    * you can convert this to **kang** and get paid
    
then you **tapon** (throw a tile)

### on your turn

Become **mano** by getting one tile (**bunot**) from the non-joker, **bunot** side

if **flores**
* **bunot** from the **flores** side, until you **bunot** a non-**flores** tile

*it is possible to win from a* ***bunot***

You are **tira** if you have 17 tiles

Typically, just throw, or **tapon** a tile. 

Alternatively, you may:
* **declare** a **secret** (four of a kind). Place the tiles face down, get paid 20, and draw from **flores**
    * as with paid **kang**, cannot reconvert to 2 pairs
* **declare** an **eskalera** and get paid ????
    * makes you ineligible for **all-up**
* get paid 10 for 13, 16, or 19 **flores** 

before you **tapon**



## winning

If you are missing only one tile to win, you are **puro** and can take the tile if anyone throws it, ever

5 sets and a pair

7 pairs and a set

When the desired card comes, either from **tapon** or **bunot**, call out **todas** because you won and recieve payment



## paying

#### 5 sets only
