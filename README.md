# cruz mahjong
For four players

The Cruz clan enjoys a game that uses mahjong tiles, mahjong words, but not mahjong rules.

## setup

1. Mix (halo) the mahjong tiles in the middle and build four walls of about even length, 2 tiles high.
  1. The end result shold be a square

2. Have the last winner roll the dice. The sum of the dice determines who is **mano**, or the starting player.
  1. Note, if both dice have the save value, the winnings will be *doubled*. Indicate this somehow

3. The **mano** can choose any wall other than their own to distribute tiles. Using the value of the dice, count inwards from the chosen wall. (Break between the the counted tiles, **flores**, and the next tile to be counted, the **bunot**). 
Starting from the tiles after the those counted, distribute 4longx2high wall sections to the **mano** first, then continue counter-clockwise until every player has 16 tiles. Deal the **mano** one more tile, the **sawi**
  1. The **mano** can choose to have their **sawi** when dealt their second 8-tiles
